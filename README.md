This is the GitHub Repository for my WiP (Work in Progress) text-based role-playing game written in Python, under the working title of "Project ALE", ALE standing for the latin phrase anguis ex ludo electionis, roughly meaning "Python Game of Choice".

The current state of Project ALE is in extreme pre-production. As this is a one-man project (for now), progress will be slow for the forseeable future while I test various ways of doing things in Python. 

The world you will eventually find in Project ALE is based on my personal worldbuilding, mainly the world of Olora, which is an plane of existence with no end, just vast seas separating endless landmasses and different cultures and regional conflicts.

Project ALE is inspired by many other games, books, films and music. Some old and some new. 
Some of the games that inspire me to create and continue to develop Project ALE include:
  - The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt and it's two expansions, Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone: My inspiration from this game is it's vast open world and vibrant characters.
  - The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and it's Dawnguard expansion: My inspiration from this game is similar to that which I derive from the Witcher 3, in addition to Skyrim's soundtrack.
  - Zork: While I will openly admit that I've not played through Zork in it's entirety yet, it has propelled my interest in making a game in this general genre.
  - The YouTube channel of Jenna Moreci (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_fcv9kBpDN4WWrfcbCrgw) for igniting my interest in writing and worldbuilding.
  - Monster Hunter World: For providing me with multiple examples of well-designed animals and monsters alike.
  - Warsim: The Realm of Aslona: For it's wonderful ASCII sprites and attention to detail.
  - The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini: I read these books as a young boy and fell in love with the world that he built. To this day, the characters and stories within the Inheritance Cycle are an enjoyable experience and are full of nostalgia.
  - A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin: For the deep interpersonal connections and plotlines.
  
Another group of people I need to acknowledge is the instructional staff at the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp, specifically Treighton, Stephanie and Jehad. These three people changed my life for the better by teaching me how to program websites, which allowed me to use the skills I learned from them to make Project ALE. Thank you.

At some point, I will have gotten far enough in this endeavor to warrant buying a web domain, and with it will come a dedicated website.

Also to be expected in the future is a conversion from Python into Unity or C++. My knowledge of Python is sketchy enough as it is (at the time of writing, it is December 1st, 2019.), I have no current interest in jumping into something as distant and complex as Unity or as unknown to me as C++. Python is relatively similar to JavaScript, so most of my proficiency is based in my studies in JavaScript and React.

Expect bi-weekly or monthly updates to this readme.
